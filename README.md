# Mock ups

All mockups designed using Adobe Illustrator CC. 

Interface design is usually the first step I take in big projects to help me to focus on the functionality and design decisions. For every project that I have pushed on here, are the GitHub repos below:

* [Badgr] - Reward your friends badges.
* [Jitter] - Twitter for Coffee.
* [Pointr] - iOS app to award your friends points.
* [Rewardr] - Give your employees rewards.

##### Learning Outcomes

- I found having mockups restricted the amount of distractions and increased the clarity of the development process.
- That the creative visualisation of an app matters just as much as the logic and functionality behind it.
