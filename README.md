# Mock ups

Interface design is usually the first step I take in big projects to help me to focus on the functionality and design decisions. For every project that I have pushed on here, are the GitHub repos below:

* [Badgr] - Reward your friends badges.
* [Jitter] - Twitter for Coffee.
* [Pointr] - iOS app to award your friends points.
* [Rewardr] - Give your employees rewards.
